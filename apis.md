description: Cloudinary is a cloud-based service that answers a website or mobile
  application&rsquo;s entire image management needs - uploads, storage, manipulations,
  optimizations and delivery. Cloudinary&rsquo;s users can easily move all their website&rsquo;s
  images to the cloud. Automatically perform smart image resizing, cropping, merging,
  overlay, watermark, apply effects, rotations and perform format conversions. All
  this without installing any complex software. Integrate social website (Facebook,
  Twitter, etc.) profile image extraction, fetch images from any online resource in
  any dimension and style to match a website&rsquo;s graphics requirements, and much
  more.
